# Governance

## Overview

This document describes how MeridianAlgo makes decisions for its open-source ecosystem.

## Maintainers

- Each repository has maintainers responsible for reviewing changes and guiding technical direction.
- Maintainers may be listed in the repository description or in a repository-specific maintainers file when applicable.

## Decision Making

### Day-to-day Changes

- Small changes are approved through standard pull request review.
